# Architecture Diagram Notes: Predicting Patient Readmissions

## **1. Overview**
The architecture of the **Predicting Patient Readmissions** project follows a **cloud-based, scalable, and serverless** design using AWS services. The system is designed to handle **data ingestion, model training, deployment, inference, and monitoring** efficiently.

## **2. Key Components & Workflow**

### **2.1 Data Ingestion & Storage**
- **Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)**
  - Stores raw and processed patient data.
  - Secure and scalable storage solution.
  - Used as a central repository for machine learning datasets.

- **Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) [Optional]**
  - If structured, relational patient data is required, RDS can be used for storage and querying.
  - Supports MySQL/PostgreSQL for relational data.

### **2.2 Data Processing & Feature Engineering**
- **AWS Glue**
  - Serverless ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) service for processing large-scale patient data.
  - Automates feature engineering and data cleaning pipelines.

- **Amazon SageMaker Processing Jobs**
  - Runs Python scripts for feature engineering and pre-model processing.
  - Ensures scalability for large datasets.

### **2.3 Model Training & Evaluation**
- **Amazon SageMaker Training**
  - Provides a managed environment for training ML models (Logistic Regression, XGBoost, Neural Networks, etc.).
  - Supports hyperparameter tuning and distributed training.
  
- **Amazon SageMaker Experiments**
  - Tracks different model versions, training performance, and hyperparameter variations.

- **Amazon CloudWatch**
  - Monitors training performance, logs, and alerts for failures or drifts in data.

### **2.4 Model Deployment & API Exposure**
- **Amazon SageMaker Endpoint**
  - Deploys the trained model as a **real-time inference endpoint**.
  - Supports auto-scaling and model versioning.
  
- **AWS Lambda**
  - Serverless function to invoke the model for batch inference or real-time prediction requests.
  - Helps in cost optimization by running only when invoked.

- **Amazon API Gateway**
  - Provides a RESTful API interface for accessing the prediction service.
  - Routes requests to AWS Lambda or SageMaker Endpoint.
  - Supports authentication and request throttling.

### **2.5 Monitoring & Continuous Integration (MLOps)**
- **Amazon CloudWatch**
  - Monitors model performance, data drift, and logs inference requests.

- **AWS Step Functions**
  - Orchestrates ML pipeline execution (data preprocessing â†’ training â†’ deployment â†’ monitoring).

- **AWS CodePipeline & GitHub Actions**
  - Automates CI/CD for model updates and API deployments.
  - Triggers retraining when new data is available.

### **2.6 Security & Compliance**
- **AWS IAM (Identity & Access Management)**
  - Restricts access to patient data and ML models.
  - Ensures role-based authentication for APIs.

- **AWS Key Management Service (KMS)**
  - Encrypts sensitive patient data in S3 and databases.
  
- **AWS Shield & WAF (Web Application Firewall)**
  - Protects APIs and endpoints from external threats and unauthorized access.

## **3. End-to-End Workflow**
1. **Data Collection**: Patient records, historical admissions, and risk factors are collected and stored in **Amazon S3 / RDS**.
2. **Data Processing**: AWS Glue and SageMaker Processing transform data and create engineered features.
3. **Model Training**: The data is used to train ML models in **SageMaker Training Jobs**.
4. **Model Deployment**: The best model is deployed as a **SageMaker Endpoint** for real-time predictions.
5. **API Exposure**: **AWS Lambda + API Gateway** expose the prediction service to external hospital systems.
6. **Monitoring & Retraining**: **CloudWatch & Step Functions** trigger alerts and automate model updates based on performance.

## **4. Scalability & Cost Optimization**
- **Serverless Architecture**: AWS Lambda ensures cost savings by running inference only when needed.
- **Auto-scaling Endpoints**: SageMaker scales model inference based on traffic.
- **Spot Instances**: Training jobs use AWS Spot instances to reduce costs.
- **Batch Processing**: Large-scale predictions are processed in SageMaker batch mode instead of real-time inference.

## **5. Conclusion**
The architecture ensures a **highly scalable, secure, and cost-efficient** machine learning pipeline for predicting patient readmissions. By leveraging AWS services, the system provides **real-time risk assessment** while maintaining **compliance with healthcare regulations (HIPAA, GDPR)**.
